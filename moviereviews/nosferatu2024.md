# Nosferatu (2024) Review

## My Thoughts

Great gothic/period horror film. I have particularly enjoyed director Robert Eggers' previous films The Witch and The Northman because of their fidelity to the time periods those films depict. This film is no different. Its so true to the Victorian era it's depicting, basically a movie that the Victorians would have made if they had access to the kind of technology that is available in 2024.

Well everything except for everyone's perfect pearly whites.

Bill Skarsgard is great as Count Orlok. I was gonna say that he's being typecast as the scary monster guy, first as Pennywise from It & It pt. 2 but actually I haven't watched any of his other projects so I was wrong there. FAKE NEWS!

Nicholas Hoult as Thomas Hutter really sells the pure dread and horror of having to do a business deal with a reanimated corpse of unquenchable hunger and lust. Like negotiating with Rupert Murdoch!

## SPOILERS

This movie has such a dreamlike quality to it, scenes blend into each other and skip like a dream and it really works for the movie. The movie feels like a nightmare that you're forced to watch, like an otherwordly creature has invaded your dreams and is making this play out 

A scene that really sells that is when Thomas Hutter reaches a crossroads in the woods, unsure of how to reach Count Orlok's castle. A carraige comes charging down the path and Thomas is caught like a deer in the headlights, the lead horses rear up and ... the next shot is the carraige, parked at the crossroads, Thomas looking at it. The door swings open by itself. The camera: looking through the carraige, you see Thomas walk towards the carraige and then his walking motion ceases, but he is still moving closer, pulled into the carraige by forces beyond his comprehension.

A another well done element of the movie is how the true nature of count Orlok is unclear until the very end. You get better and better views as the movie goes on, but the true disgusting nature of a reanimated rotting blood hungry corpse is revealed until the very last scene. In the first act of the movie, this is really well done, Count Orlok is always sihouetted, just out of focus, the camera pans just as he turns to face Thomas etc. Thank you Robert Eggers for building up that suspense.

I think watching Count Orlok feed from Thomas: a vaguely sexual pose crouched over his prone body, the gulping sound of greedy blood drinking, so grotesque; really sold the avaritious nature of Count Orlok.
