# General
Don't buy "light" olive oil if you are looking for the health benefits of olive oil. This is solvent extracted and is basically the same as other industrial seed oils ala sunflower oil, canola oil, corn oil etc.

Supermarket oils are also probably not good, look for a harvest date. This will be a challenge, Whole Foods will usually have some. It does get pricey. Anything older than 2 years is trash. If you buy a supermarket oil and it has a best by date within 1 year, its probably already 2 years old and is trash. If you have supermarket oil that is expired, smell it. If it smells rancid at all, I would say toss it (personal financial health notwithstanding)

I have the good fortune to live within driving distance of an olive oil farm, so I can buy from there.

For everyone else, from *Salt Fat Acid Heat*, Samin Nosrat recommends "Kirkland Signature Extra Virgin Olive Oil" from Costco, I can attest that this is stuff is really good, there is not a huge taste difference between this stuff and the milder olive oils that my local farm provides.

# Olio Nuovo
Olio Nuovo is freshly pressed olive oil. It is cloudy at room temp, which goes away after about a month.

It is pretty fragrant if you stir fry with it, and has a stronger flavor than something older, but the difference is subtle.
