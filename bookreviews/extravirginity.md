## A quick recap
Tom Mueller explores the world of Olive oil, its history, growing practices as well as the uncertain future of global olive oil

## My thoughts

### The Good

I had known about extra virgin olive oil being "cold pressed". But I was not aware that the leftover stuff is called "Pomace" and that you can use solvents (like hexane) to get that last bit of oil out from the pomace (in the same way that _seed oils_ are extracted)

### The olive oil boomer

Theres a chapter or two about how Greeks and Romans were using olive oil. Surprise detour to Israel Palestine! This is Tom building up the divinity of what is essentially fruit juice.

You get a tour through the Italian country side and talk to some farmers (who pick their olives by hand) who gripe about being priced out and sob that olive oil is not the premium product that wine is. The farmer wishes that an Austrian Wine Scandal would happen to olive oil. Side Note: The [austrian wine scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Austrian_diethylene_glycol_wine_scandal) was when austrian wine producers spiked their wine with antifreeze to make it taste sweeter and ~~people~~ the Austrian wine industry died. 

So one comment, of course this farmer wants olive oil to be a premium brand-name based product like wine. The farmer plays it off in the name of quality assurance. I didn't really convince me, but I'm the guy who went out and bought olive oil from a local farm after reading this book, so maybe it did convince me.

Life is too short to use bad olive oil, if you want bad olive oil, you might as well buy canola oil, at least that stuff isn't pretending to be anything other than what it is.
