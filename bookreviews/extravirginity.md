## A quick recap
Tom Mueller explores the world of Olive oil, its history, growing practices as well as the uncertain future of global olive oil

## My thoughts

### The Good

I had known about extra virgin olive oil being "cold pressed". But I was not aware that the leftover stuff is called "Pomace" and that you can use solvents (like hexane) to get that last bit of oil out from the pomace (in the same way that _seed oils_ are extracted)

Theres a chapter or two about how Greeks and Romans were using olive oil. This is Tom building up the divinity of what is essentially fruit juice.

And then the book somewhat falls off the rails. 

### Old man shakes his fist at the sky

You get a tour through the Italian country side and talk to some farmers (who pick their olives by hand) who gripe about being priced out and sob that olive oil is not the premium product that wine is. The farmer wishes that an Austrian Wine Scandal would happen to olive oil. Side Note: The [austrian wine scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Austrian_diethylene_glycol_wine_scandal) was when austrian wine producers spiked their wine with antifreeze to make it taste sweeter and ~~people~~ the Austrian wine industry died. 

So one comment, of course this farmer 

And then Tom takes a detour around the Mediterrenean to Israel/Palestine, almost purely to emphasize that olive oil has geopolitical relevance, and then to Spain.

This is where Tom starts shaking

Honestly alot of this book is griping from various Italian Olive Farmers about how "they don't make it like they used to" and "those damn Spainards don't appreciate the divinity of olive oil nearly as much as they should"

Sure I get it,
